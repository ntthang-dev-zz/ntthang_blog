        disable = false
        simple = false
    [privacy.youtube]
        disable = false
        privacyEnhanced = true
```

To learn more about privacy configuration check the [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/).

### Custom CSS

To add custom CSS you have to create a folder called ```assets``` in the root of your project. Then, create another folder called ```css``` inside ```assets```. And finally, a file called ```custom.css``` inside ```css``` with your styles.

```bash
$ mkdir -p ./assets/css/
```

## Archetypes

Terrassa includes three base archetypes:
* *default*: for content such as blogs posts.
* *section*: for the sections on your Home page.
* *page*: for pages like the About page.

So be careful. Creating a new site with Hugo also creates a default archetype that replaces the one provided by Terrassa.

### Home and Single pages

To create your home page run the following command inside your Hugo site:

```bash
$ hugo new _index.md -k page
```

Or to create another page:

```bash
$ hugo new example.md -k page
```

You'll get something like this:

```markdown
---
title: ""
description: ""
images: []
draft: true
menu: main
weight: 0
---
```

Some properties are used as follows:
* *title*: is the name that will be displayed in the menu. In the rest of the single pages the main title of the content.
* *description*: in the case of the home page the description is not shown. In the rest of the single pages it is shown as a subtitle.
* *images*: in the case of the home page the first image is used as the background image for the hero and to share on social networks (with [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/abouts-cards.html) and [Facebook Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/)). In every other page or post is used only for share on social networks.
* *weight*: sets the order of the items in the menu.

## Home page Sections

To create a new section in your Home page follow the next steps:

```bash
$ hugo new sections/example.md -k section
```

You'll come across something like this:

```markdown
---
title: "Example"
description: ""
draft: true
weight: 0
---
```

The *title* is used as the title of your new section and the content is the body. At this moment the *description* is not used for anything.

The *weight* defines the order in case of having more than one section.

### Blog or List pages

To create a Blog or a page with a similar structure follow these steps:

```bash
$ hugo new posts/_index.md -k page
```

> In this case it is only necessary to set, if wanted, the *title* and the *weight* in the *_index.md*.

To add a new posts run the following command:

```bash
$ hugo new posts/bad-example.md
```

Inside this file you'll find something like this:

```markdown
---
title: "Bad example"
description: ""
date: 2018-12-27T21:09:45+01:00
publishDate: 2018-12-27T21:09:45+01:00
author: "John Doe"
images: []
draft: true
tags: []
---
```
The *title* and *description* are used as the main title and subtitle respectively.

> You can find more information about each parameter in the [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).

Then, the corresponding section will show a list of cards with the *title*, the *date*, a *summary of the content* (truncated to 480 words) and a list of *tags* if any.

### Contact

For the contact page follow these instructions:

```bash
$ hugo new contact/_index.md -k page
```

The *title* and *description* will be used as the main title and subtitle respectively with a contact form. The rest of the options are defined in the [config.toml](https://github.com/danielkvist/hugo-terrassa-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml).

## Multilingual Support

If your site is multilingual, add each language to your config.toml parameters with the following structure:

```bash
[languages]
    [languages.en]
        languageName = "en"
        weight = 1
        contentDir = "content/en"
      [languages.de]
        languageName = "de"
        weight = 2
        contentDir = "content/de"
      [languages.fr]
        languageName = "fr"
        weight = 3
        contentDir = "content/fr"
```

The theme assumes you have one default language, defined in config.toml as defaultContentLanguage. These pages will be at root of the URL, while the other languages will be in their own subdirectory.

You can overwrite all Site parameters in config.url by adding them to the respective language, for example:

```bash
[languages.de]
  languageName = "de"
  weight = 2
  contentDir = "content/de"
  title = "Das ist der deutsche Titel"
  description = "Das ist die deutsche Beschreibung"
```

For translating the contact form, add these parameters:

```bash
[languages.de.params]
  [languages.de.params.form] # Translate contact form fields
    inputNameLabel = "Name"
    inputNamePlaceholder = "Dein Name"
    inputEmailLabel = "E-mail"
    inputEmailPlaceholder = "Deine E-Mail-Adresse"
    inputMsgLabel = "Schreib etwas"
    inputSubmitValue = "Abschicken"
    [languages.de.params.cta] # Translate Call To Action
        show = true
        cta = "Kontakt"
        link = "de/kontakt/" # Relative URL
```

Activate the language switcher in the header by setting:

```bash
[params.languageSwitcher]
    show = true
```
